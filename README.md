# NEAT-Platforming
NEAT Platforming is a 2D platformer in which the player character is controlled by a evolving neural network. It also includes a way to vizualize the different ways the NEAT algorithm can augment the topology of a neural network. This project is currently still in development.

NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies ([NEAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroevolution_of_augmenting_topologies)) is a genetic algorithm developed by Ken Stanley in 2002. It generates evolving artificial neural networks by mutating both the weights of connections and the overall structure of the networks (the topology). You can read more about the original NEAT algorithm [here](http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.ec02.pdf).
